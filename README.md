Simple browser-game 

This is a simple browser game i made about a year ago. 

So whats this game about?
  Its a idle game which starts with you crossing the line on the top of the screen.
  After some time you will unlock the first miner and it will start generating "corsses" for you.
  
Right now everything is very unbalancd and i will try to change the values in the future.
